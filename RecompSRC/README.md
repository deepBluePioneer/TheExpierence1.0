# KAR-Decomp
Yet another Kirby Air Ride decomp, but with [DTK](https://github.com/encounter/decomp-toolkit). This is based on the [OG Decomp](https://github.com/doldecomp/kar). Using any useable symbols from the many Maps and their work. This repo does add new symbols or changes the Map's names to make them more readable. The end goal is to make a disassembly and decomp for every region. Symbols found/named in either branch will be copied to the others, but might take some time to update. Follow the Branch Map for specifics.

Special thanks to [WowJinxy](https://github.com/wowjinxy), [Encounter](https://github.com/encounter), and the [GC/Wii Decomp Community](https://discord.gg/hKx3FJJgrV).

# Branch Map

This repo has a few branches, where each focuses on something differant.

- DTK || This branch uses DTK and is based on the OG Decomp. It preserves all the ROM offsets and extra info. The goal is to make a diassembly that can be used for Gecko Codes, and making a shiftable ROM. No C code will be in this branch.

- Ghidra C Code (You Are Here) || This branch holds the outputted C++ code from Ghidra. Will not compile to a full binary and might take time to update with the rest of the symbols from the DTK branch.

# A Disassembly?
This branch will not contain C/C++ code. Instead it's a disassembly where the ROMs are broken into ASM, that ASM is then renamed and notes are added.

# Why Not C/C++?
We want to keep the ROM offset notes and assembly instructions. So we know what we are replacing with Gecko Codes or registers we can use.

## Extracting the assets from your ISO

1. Grab a NA, JP, or PAL ISO of Kirby Air Ride. We can not provide one.

2. Extract it yourself using Dolphin or run the pyton script `ExtractROM.py`.

`python ExtractROM.py <path to your ISO>`
